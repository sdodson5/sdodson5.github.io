Resources for Students
----
Below are links to research and internship opportunities for undergraduate students, resources for applying to graduate school, and organizations working to increase diversity, recognize achievements of underrepresented mathematicians, and create an inclusive culture. These are by no means the only resources, they are the ones that I am aware of.
