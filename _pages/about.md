Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor in the [Mathematics Department](https://www.colby.edu/math/) at [Colby College](https://www.colby.edu/). I am an applied mathematician and I enjoy using mathematics to explore and learn about diverse topics in biology and the natural sciences. In much of my research, I develop and use computational methods to study the formation and stability of spatiotemporal patterns. Please see my research and publication pages for more information!

Previously, I was a Krener Assistant Professor in the [Mathematics Department](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/) at the [University of California Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/). I received my PhD in [Applied Mathematics](https://appliedmath.brown.edu/) from Brown University, where I worked with [Bj&ouml;rn Sandstede](https://bjornsandstede.com/).
